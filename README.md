WeWorkflow
================

An [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to quickly access and manage other workflows' info and folders. 
Derived from `alfred-extension`, an [Alfred2 extension](https://github.com/jmjeong/alfred-extension/tree/master/managealfredextension) created by 
Jaemok Jeong ([jmjeong](https://github.com/jmjeong)). 

Main changes: dropped `open in iTerm2`, `export`, and `disable` actions, added access to workflow info, folder, and cache, config, detection of hotkey conflicts. Workflows' info now stored in a `sqlite` database for faster access.

1. Download the most recent release of `alfred-WeWorkflow` from [Github](https://github.com/giovannicoppola/alfred-weworkflow/releases/latest) and double-click to install
2. _Optional:_ Setup a hotkey to launch `alfred-WeWorkflow`
4. _Optional:_ Change the keyword to launch `alfred-WeWorkflow` (currently set to `ww`)


<h1 id="usage">Basic Usage üìñ</h1>

`ww` or hotkey will launch `WeWorkflow`, type to search workflows (or use `advanced search` below. 

1. `return (‚èé)` will open the workflow folder in Alfred's file browser
2. `shift-return (‚áß‚èé)` will show the Workflow's **config** screen in Alfred
3. `control-return (‚åÉ‚èé)` will show the Workflow's **info** in large font (including hotkey conflicts with active üî¥ and disabled üü† workflows)
4. `command-return (‚åò‚èé)` will open the Workflow's **folder** in Finder
5. `command-shift-return (‚åò‚áß‚èé)` will open the Workflow's **folder** in Terminal
6. `option-return (‚å•‚èé)` will open the Workflow's **cache folder** (if existing) in Finder
7. `option-shift-return (‚å•‚áß‚èé)` will open the Workflow's **cache folder** (if existing) in Terminal
8. `fn-return (fn‚èé)` will **launch** the workflow with the first keyword
9. `control-option-shift-return (^‚å•‚áß‚èé)` will open the Workflow's **data folder** (if existing) in Finder



## Advanced search üîç
- enter `field:`, where `field` is any of the fields below. Example: `name:wework`
	- `name`
